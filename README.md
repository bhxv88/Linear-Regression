# LAB-2 | LINEAR-REGRERSSION

Name: Baibhav Kaphle

## Task-1 | Simple linear regression

In this task linear regression model is trained from  California housing as its training dataset for predicting median house value.
It followed the pipeline as follows:

1.Data Retrieval and Collection
2.Data Cleaning
3.Feature Design
4.Algorithm Selection
5.Loss Function Selection
6.Model Learning (Training)
7.Model Evaluation

## Task-2 | Multiple linear regression

In this task, multiple linear regression model was developed without using the target variable(MedHouseVal). Instead scaling is done and model performance is compared with task 1


## Tools used

1. matplotlib
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. jupyter notebook
5. python
